# Core Features Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of core features for the job board platform as specified in `design.md`.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Job Aggregation Service (Feature 1 from design.md)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Implementation:**
- `JobAggregationService` class manages multiple job data sources
- Supports registration of sources with custom fetch functions and refresh intervals
- Automatically removes duplicate jobs based on title, company, and location
- Tracks source metadata (last sync time, total jobs)
- Merges new jobs with existing jobs intelligently

**Test Coverage:** 7 tests, all passing

**Key Methods:**
- `registerSource()` - Add new job sources
- `syncJobs()` - Fetch jobs from all sources
- `processAndStoreJobs()` - Deduplicate and merge jobs
- `getSourceStats()` - Get statistics for all sources

### 2. Job Matching Service (Feature 6 from design.md)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Implementation:**
- `JobMatchingService` calculates match scores between user profiles and jobs
- Skill-based matching with weighted scoring (60% skills, 30% experience, 10% location)
- Experience alignment detection (under/perfect/over)
- Gap analysis showing matched vs. missing skills
- Sorts jobs by relevance score

**Test Coverage:** 16 tests, all passing

**Key Features:**
- Match scores from 0-100%
- Detailed skill analysis (matched and missing)
- Experience level alignment
- Location preference matching
- Batch processing for multiple jobs

### 3. Application Service (Feature 3 from design.md)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Implementation:**
- `ApplicationService` manages the complete application workflow
- Session-based application process
- Pre-filled application data using user profiles
- Application status tracking (applied, under_review, interview, rejected, accepted)
- Duplicate application prevention
- Application statistics and filtering

**Test Coverage:** 14 tests, all passing

**Key Features:**
- Multi-step application process
- Session management
- Status tracking
- User application history
- Application statistics by status

### 4. Job Listing Service (Feature 4 from design.md)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Implementation:**
- `JobListingService` provides recent jobs with freshness indicators
- Advanced filtering (location, category, skills, remote)
- Freshness badges ("New" < 24hrs, "Fresh" < 48hrs)
- Human-readable job age display
- Time-range based filtering
- Metadata with new jobs count and last updated timestamp

**Test Coverage:** 20 tests, all passing

**Key Features:**
- Freshness indicators with color-coded badges
- Multiple filter types
- Sorted by most recent first
- New jobs counter
- Time-range queries

### 5. Resume Parser Service (Feature 5 from design.md)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Implementation:**
- `ResumeParserService` extracts structured data from resumes
- Privacy protection with email and phone masking
- Skills extraction from predefined keyword list
- Experience calculation from multiple patterns
- Education and certification extraction
- Provides both masked and raw contact information

**Test Coverage:** 24 tests, all passing

**Key Features:**
- Email masking: `john.doe@example.com` → `joh***@example.com`
- Phone masking: `+91-9876543210` → `+91-****-***-3210`
- Technical skills detection (Python, SQL, ML frameworks, etc.)
- Experience extraction from various formats
- Education degree recognition
- Location extraction for Indian cities

## Test Results

All services are fully tested with comprehensive test coverage:

```
✓ ApplicationService.test.js     (14 tests)
✓ JobAggregationService.test.js   (7 tests)
✓ JobListingService.test.js      (20 tests)
✓ JobMatchingService.test.js     (16 tests)
✓ ResumeParserService.test.js    (24 tests)

Total: 81 tests passing
```

## Build Status

✅ Build successful
✅ All tests passing
✅ No linting errors

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Import services
import {
  JobAggregationService,
  JobMatchingService,
  ApplicationService,
  JobListingService,
  ResumeParserService
} from './services';

// 1. Aggregate jobs from multiple sources
const aggregator = new JobAggregationService();
aggregator.registerSource({
  name: 'linkedin',
  fetchLatestJobs: async () => fetchFromLinkedIn(),
  refreshInterval: 6
});
const jobs = await aggregator.syncJobs();

// 2. Parse user resume
const parser = new ResumeParserService();
const resumeData = parser.parseResume(resumeText);

// 3. Calculate job matches
const matcher = new JobMatchingService();
const matchedJobs = matcher.calculateMatchesForJobs(resumeData, jobs);

// 4. Get recent jobs with freshness indicators
const listingService = new JobListingService();
listingService.setJobs(jobs);
const { jobs: recentJobs, metadata } = await listingService.getRecentJobs({
  location: 'Bangalore',
  category: 'Data Science'
});

// 5. Handle job application
const appService = new ApplicationService();
const session = appService.initiateApplication('job123', 'user456');
const result = appService.submitApplication({
  sessionId: session.sessionId,
  jobId: 'job123',
  userId: 'user456',
  personalInfo: resumeData.personalInfo,
  coverLetter: 'I am interested...'
});
```

## Design Alignment

This implementation fulfills the following features from `design.md`:

1. ✅ **Real-Time Job Data Integration** - JobAggregationService
2. ✅ **Direct Application Functionality** - ApplicationService
3. ✅ **Recent Jobs Display** - JobListingService
4. ✅ **Resume Upload & Parsing** - ResumeParserService
5. ✅ **Resume-Based Job Matching** - JobMatchingService

## Next Steps

These services are ready to be integrated into the frontend components:
- Use `JobListingService` to enhance the job listing UI with freshness badges
- Integrate `JobMatchingService` to show match scores on job cards
- Use `ApplicationService` to implement the application workflow
- Integrate `ResumeParserService` to enhance the ResumeUpload component
- Use `JobAggregationService` to fetch jobs from external sources

## Technical Details

**Testing Framework:** Vitest v3.2.4
**Language:** JavaScript (ES Modules)
**Coverage:** 81 tests across 5 service classes
**Documentation:** Comprehensive README and inline comments
